WARNING: this is a draft documenting a work-in-progress!

# Summary

The goal of this project is to move the implementation of the BotWar game implementation into a plug-in and to turn
Scalatron into a framework and server for hosting a variety of such pluggable games.


# Decisions

The primary decisions concern the level of abstraction: what should the framework require all pluggable games to
have in common?


# TODO
